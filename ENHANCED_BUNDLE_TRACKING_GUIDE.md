## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### Enhanced Product Comparison

**Old Code** (Basic names only):
```javascript
addedNames: newProducts
  .filter(p => productsAddedIds.includes(String(p.id || p.product_id)))
  .map(p => p.name || p.product_name || 'Unknown')
```

**New Code** (Full details):
```javascript
const addedProducts = newProducts
  .filter(p => productsAddedIds.includes(String(p.id || p.product_id)))
  .map(p => ({
    name: p.name || p.product_name || 'Unknown',
    price: p.price || p.product_price || 0,
    code: p.code || p.product_code || 'N/A'
  }));

// In metadata:
addedDetails: addedProducts.map(p => 
  `${p.name} (${p.code}, ₱${p.price})`
)
```

### Better Console Logging

Added debug logs for tracking:
```javascript
console.log("🔍 Comparing bundle products:");
console.log("  Old products:", oldProducts);
console.log("  New products:", newProducts);
console.log("🔍 Product analysis:");
console.log("  Added IDs:", productsAddedIds);
console.log("  Removed IDs:", productsRemovedIds);
```
