# 🔐 Manager Role Access Fix

## Problem Identified
Managers could not edit products or bundles because:
1. **Database RLS policies** only allowed `is_admin = true` (old schema)
2. **Service layer checks** were missing for role validation
3. Activity logs were created even when updates failed due to permission errors

## Solution Implemented

### 1. ✅ Updated Service Layer (ProductService.js)
- Added role check in `updateProduct()` function
- Allows **both admin AND manager** roles to update products
- Provides clear error messages for permission issues
- Added RLS-specific error handling

### 2. ✅ Updated Service Layer (BundleService.js)
- Added role check in `createBundle()` function
- Added role check in `updateBundle()` function
- Allows **both admin AND manager** roles to manage bundles
- Provides clear error messages for permission issues

### 3. ✅ Created Database Migration (UPDATE_RLS_FOR_MANAGERS.sql)
**Location:** `database/UPDATE_RLS_FOR_MANAGERS.sql`

This migration updates all RLS policies to support the manager role:
- Products management (create, read, update, delete)
- Bundles management
- Bundle products management
- Brands management
- Product images storage (upload, update, delete)

## 🚀 How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Run the SQL Migration
1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Open the file: `database/UPDATE_RLS_FOR_MANAGERS.sql`
4. Run the entire script
5. Verify success (no errors should appear)

### Step 2: Test with Manager Account
1. Log in with a manager account
2. Try to edit a product
3. Try to create/edit a bundle
4. Verify that:
   - ✅ Updates are saved successfully
   - ✅ Activity logs are created
   - ✅ Changes are reflected immediately in the UI
   - ✅ Success message appears

### Step 3: Verify Role Restrictions

**Test Admin Account:**
1. Log in as admin
2. ✅ Can create/edit/delete products
3. ✅ Can create/edit/delete bundles
4. ✅ Can promote/demote/delete users
5. ✅ Can view all logs

**Test Manager Account:**
1. Log in as manager
2. ✅ Can create/edit/delete products
3. ✅ Can create/edit/delete bundles
4. ✅ Can view orders and customers
5. ✅ Can view activity logs
6. ❌ Cannot access user management (promote/demote/delete)

**Test Employee Account:**
1. Log in as employee
2. ✅ Can view products and bundles (read-only)
3. ✅ Can view orders and customers (read-only)
4. ✅ Can view activity logs (read-only)
5. ❌ Try to edit a product → Should show error: "Only admins and managers can update products"
6. ❌ Try to create a bundle → Should show error: "Only admins and managers can create bundles"
7. ❌ Cannot access user management

## 📋 Role Hierarchy (Complete Implementation)

### 👤 Employee
**View-Only Access**
- ✅ View products and bundles (read-only)
- ✅ View brands (read-only)
- ✅ View orders (read-only)
- ✅ View customers (read-only)

## 🔍 What Was Fixed in Code

### ProductService.js - updateProduct()
```javascript
// Before: No role check
static async updateProduct(id, productData) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('products')
    .update(productData)
    ...
}

// After: Role check for admin AND manager
static async updateProduct(id, productData) {
  // Check user role
  const { data: profile } = await supabase
    .from('profiles')
    .select('role')
    .eq('id', user.id)
    .single()
  
  // Allow admin and manager
  if (profile.role !== 'admin' && profile.role !== 'manager') {
    return handleSupabaseError(new Error('Only admins and managers can update products'))
  }
  ...
}
```

### Database RLS Policies
```sql
-- Before: Only admins
CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage products" ON products
  FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles 
      WHERE id = auth.uid() AND is_admin = true
    )
  );

-- After: Admins and Managers
CREATE POLICY "Admins and Managers can manage products" ON products
  FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles 
      WHERE id = auth.uid() 
      AND (role = 'admin' OR role = 'manager')
    )
  );
```

## � Employee Restrictions - What Happens?

When an **employee** tries to perform restricted actions:

### Attempting to Edit Products:
```
❌ Error: "Only admins and managers can update products"
- Service layer blocks the request
- No database call is made
- Activity log is NOT created (action never happened)
```

### Attempting to Create Bundles:
```
❌ Error: "Only admins and managers can create bundles"
- Service layer blocks the request
- No database call is made
- Activity log is NOT created (action never happened)
```

### Attempting to Delete Items:
```
❌ Error: "Only admins and managers can delete [item]"
- Service layer blocks the request
- Item remains in database
- Activity log is NOT created
```

### UI Behavior (Recommended):
For better UX, you should also **hide edit/delete buttons** for employees:
- Show "View Only" mode in product/bundle forms
- Disable save/delete buttons
- Display a badge: "Read-Only Access"

## 📝 Technical Notes

- **Service layer checks** provide frontend validation (fast, user-friendly errors)
- **RLS policies** provide database-level security (absolute enforcement)
- **Both layers must be updated** for full functionality
- Activity logs will **only be created when actions actually succeed**
- Error messages now **clearly indicate permission issues**
- Employees can still **view everything** but cannot modify data

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [ ] Manager can create products
- [ ] Manager can edit products
- [ ] Manager can delete products
- [ ] Manager can create bundles
- [ ] Manager can edit bundles
