# 🎉 Product Activity Logs - Complete!

## ✅ What I Just Added

I've added activity logging to ALL product operations:

- Logs when a new product is created
- Example: `"Created product: Gaming Keyboard (SKU: KB-001, Stock: 50)"`

### 2. **Product Update** ✅
**File:** `ProductCreate.jsx`
- Logs when a product is edited
- Shows what changed
- Example: `"Updated product: Gaming Keyboard (changed: name, price, stock)"`

### 3. **Product Delete** ✅
**File:** `Inventory.jsx`
- Logs when a product is deleted
- Example: `"Deleted product: Gaming Keyboard (SKU: KB-001)"`

### 4. **Stock Updates** ✅
