## Quick Implementation

### Step 1: Add to Your Component

```jsx
import { usePermissions } from '../hooks/usePermissions';
import { PERMISSIONS } from '../utils/permissions';
import ProtectedAction from '../components/ProtectedAction';

function MyComponent() {
  const permissions = usePermissions();
  
  return (
    <Box>
      {/* Show button only if user has permission */}
      {permissions.canDeleteProduct && (
        <Button onClick={handleDelete}>Delete</Button>
      )}
      
      {/* Or wrap with ProtectedAction */}
      <ProtectedAction permission={PERMISSIONS.PRODUCT_DELETE}>
        <Button onClick={handleDelete}>Delete</Button>
      </ProtectedAction>
    </Box>
  );
}
```

### Step 2: Check Permission Before Action

```jsx
const handleDelete = () => {
  if (!permissions.canDeleteProduct) {
    alert('You do not have permission to delete products');
    return;
  }
  
  // Proceed with deletion
  deleteProduct(productId);
};
```

### Step 3: Show Role-Specific Messages

```jsx
if (permissions.isEmployee) {
  return (
    <Alert severity="info">
      As an Employee, you cannot delete products. 
      Contact a Manager if you need to delete this item.
    </Alert>
  );
}
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Test the System**
   - Log in as Employee
   - Try to delete a product (should show error)
   - Try to create a product (should work)
   - Try to access User Management (should be hidden or show error)

2. ✅ **Apply to All Features**
   - Add permission checks to Product Management
   - Add permission checks to Order Management
   - Add permission checks to User Management
   - Add permission checks to Promotions
   - Hide/disable unauthorized menu items

3. ✅ **Verify Each Role**
   - Test as Admin (all features work)
   - Test as Manager (operational features work, no user management)
   - Test as Employee (limited features only)
